## Features

Feature set is small by design, because the app aims to be as lean as possible.

- **Bus lines and stops**: detailed list of all available bus lines & stops.
- **Favorites**: save your favorite bus stops for quick access.
- **Search**: you can serach by name or by stop ID.

## Data provided by AUCORSA

This application is not affiliated with nor the official app developed by AUCORSA. All information related to bus lines, routes, stops, and arrival times is provided by AUCORSA, the company responsible for urban public transport.

The main goal of this app is to facilitate intuitive and accessible access to public information, enhancing the experience of public transport users. We aim to promote sustainable and efficient mobility by offering tools that encourage the use of public transport as a convenient and responsible alternative for urban mobility.

This independent initiative is committed to providing accurate and up-to-date data, though it is important to note that AUCORSA is the original source of all information. We recommend always verifying the data with official channels to ensure maximum accuracy.
